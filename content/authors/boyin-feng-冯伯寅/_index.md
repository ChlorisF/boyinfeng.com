Boyin Feng is a Master's student of Social Cognition and International Relations. Her research interests include intergroup relations, cultural psychology, political psychology, and affective science. 

Some of the research questions she is currently concerned about include: 1) how affective polarisation and ideological polarisation interact; 2) whether and how group identity implicates in intergroup emotion recognition and regulation; 3) how cultural values and political ideologies shape social identities and breed polarization, intergroup conflict, and discrimination.
