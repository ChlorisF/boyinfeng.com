Boyin studies social psychology and political science. Her interdisciplinary research interests span intergroup relations, cultural/political psychology, political neuroscience, and affective science. 

She is especially interested in exploring questions at the nexus of identity, ideology, emotion, and culture. Some of her current research inquiries include:

- How do affective polarization and ideological polarization connect and interact?<br>
- How do group identities (in-group vs out-group) and cultural differences shape the experience, expression, and regulation of emotions?<br>
- How do cultural values and political ideologies influence social identities and intergroup dynamics like polarization, conflict, and discrimination?<be>

Boyin received training in computational neuroscience from Neuromatch Academy 2022 and has independently written R codes for two projects (also organised sessions in *Gorilla* usage and statistical analyses in RStudio). She speaks Mandarin Chinese, English, and French fluently, as well as some Latin and ancient Greek.

Outside of research, she enjoys cooking, learning languages, playing the piano, wandering through the parks, and watching dog videos (especially of Golden Retrievers and Samoyeds).
