Research on typical and atypical development provides insight into the origins of individual differences in face and emotion recognition abilities. Findings indicate that both genetic and environmental factors contribute to variability through complex interactions.

Typical development studies show that while basic recognition abilities emerge early, configural and holistic processing take time to develop. Skills improve dramatically from childhood to adulthood, highlighting the role of experience. Preferential exposure leads to own-race biases. 

Atypical development reveals potential genetic bases. Individuals with autism or prosopagnosia have face processing deficits linked to genetic mutations and neural abnormalities. Dissociations between skills in syndromes like Williams syndrome demonstrate distinct processing routes. Heritability studies estimate high genetic influence.

Overall, genes likely determine basic neural architecture and individual potential. However, environmental stimulation is essential for shaping connections and skill progression. Further research using longitudinal and neuroimaging approaches is needed to elucidate precise mechanisms within this gene-environment interplay.
